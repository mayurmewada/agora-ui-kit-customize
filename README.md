- pinnedVideoContainer: Styling for the main video container.
- maxViewContainer: Styling for the maximum view container.
- scrollViewContainer: Styling for the scroll view container.
- localBtnContainer: Styling for the local button container.
- minViewContainer: Styling for the minimum view container.
- localBtnStyles: Styles for specific local buttons like mute video, mute audio, and end call.
- customIcon: Custom icons for mic, mic off, videocam, videocam off, and call end.
  
Feel free to adjust these properties according to your preferences.

Handling Callbacks
Callbacks allow you to define actions triggered by specific events within the UI. Here's an example of how you can handle the EndCall callback:

In this example, the EndCall callback toggles the visibility of a chat window based on the screen width.
